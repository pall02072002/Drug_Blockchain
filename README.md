### 1. **Project Title**

   - Drug Chain Supply Management System using Blockchain

### 2. **Created by**

   - Tanishka Das
   - Pallavi Dhandar
   - Jatush Hingu
   - Akash Nadar

### 3. **Description**

   This website is a comprehensive platform developed to ensure the transparency, security, and efficiency of the drug supply chain. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, it provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The backend, powered by Node.js and MongoDB, ensures robust data handling and real-time processing. The blockchain component, developed using Solidity and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, guarantees immutable and secure transactions, tracking drugs from the manufacturer to the consumer. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring scalability, portability, and easy deployment across different environments. Additionally, Truffle and Ganache UI have been utilized for blockchain development and testing. We also integrated an AI chatbot to enhance user interaction and support within the platform.

### 4. **Features**

   - Secure tracking of drugs from manufacturing to delivery
   - Tamper-proof records
   - Real-time monitoring and verification
   - Compliance with regulations
   - Access controls for different stakeholders
   - AI chatbot for user support

   - Ganache UI for blockchain testing
   - Web3.js for blockchain interaction
   - AI chatbot for user assistance

### 6. **Installation Instructions**

   - **Prerequisites**:
     - Install Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, Truffle, and Ganache UI
     - Install Metamask for Geth Testnet
     - Set up AI chatbot (details provided in aichatbot folder)
   - **Installation of dependencies**:
     - Run `npm install` to install required dependencies for the frontend and backend
   - **Configuration settings**:
     - Update environment variables and MongoDB connection settings
     - Configure the blockchain network with Ganache UI and Metamask
   - **Running the application locally**:
     - Run `docker-compose up` to set up the application containers
     - Deploy smart contracts using `truffle migrate` after connecting to Ganache UI
     - Run `npm start` to start the web server

### 7. **Usage**

   - **Interacting with the blockchain network**:
     - Access the Metamask wallet linked to the Geth Testnet to monitor transactions
     - Use the AI chatbot to guide you through the process
   - **Managing drug supply chain records**:
     - View and update drug records on the platform, which are securely stored and tracked on the blockchain
   - **Verifying transactions**:
     - Verify the authenticity of transactions using the blockchain explorer linked with Sepolia Testnet

### 8. **Smart Contracts**

   - **Description**:
     - The smart contracts handle drug creation, tracking, and delivery verification
   - **Deployment**:
     - Contracts are deployed on the Sepolia testnet using Truffle and Ganache UI
   - **Functions**:
     - Functions include adding drugs to the supply chain, tracking their movement, and verifying delivery

### 15. **Development Process**

   - **Blockchain setup**:
     - We used **Ganache UI** to simulate the Ethereum blockchain locally.
     - Contracts were written in Solidity and migrated using **Truffle**.
     - Interactions between the front end and blockchain were made possible with **Web3.js**.
   - **AI Chatbot**:
     - An AI-powered chatbot is integrated for user support, assisting with navigating the platform and providing guidance on supply chain interactions.
